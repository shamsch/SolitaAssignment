# Welcome to my pre-assignment submission for Solita's Dev Academy 2022!

Hi, I am **Shamsur Raza Chowdhury** and this is my pre-assignment submission for Solita's Dev Academy 2022. The code for this assignment is available on two different GitHub repositories:
the Node.js back-end repository is [here](https://github.com/shamsch/city-bike-app-backend) and the React.js front-end repository is [here](https://github.com/shamsch/city-bike-app-frontend). The reason it is split into two repositories is because I initially wanted to create a mobile front-end with React Native, but I later decided to create a web front-end with React.js. You will find the full documentation for the respective repositories in the README.md files located at the root of each repositories. Both, the front and backend, is hosted live on cloud for preview. 

<br/>

I hope you enjoy reviewing the code and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you have any troubles accessing the links.


Best regards, <br/>
